README.txt

Key points:
- The server part of the assignment was completed by Sara Chadwick and Salvador Gutierrez,
  with help from Mia Ngo (the client was completed by Haisley Brooking, wth help from Mia
  Ngo)
- During checkoff, there was an issue with the load function. This has been fixed; it had
  to do with the way spaces were parsed from the save file
- This server does not return a file_load_error, as we have not been able to replicate or
  test a situation that would cause an issue loading a file
- We don't know of any specific bugs; but any comments or feedback would be VERY welcome!
  We put a lot of time and love into this project, and we want to see it be the best it 
  can be

Thank you for your time!
